who develop JSX and Why JSX ?

writing code using plain javascript in react its difficult thats why facebok developers

develop the features JSX. 

jsx is not part of react . (type react in console show to student)

jsx is a advanced feature of react.


what is JSX?

jsx is a syntax extension of javascript in otherwords we can say  html like a syntax.

 its not javascript xml.

inside jsx we can write any plain javascipt code in react.js

 {}

whatever we write inside curly praces inside thats called jsx

Example:

const firstname="manavan";

const lastname="learncode";

<h1>{firstname}</h1>
<h2>{lastname}</h2>

{array.map(()=>{
    return(
        .....
        some code statement
    )
}) }

*.while writing program in react we will confused 

  after return section whatever we write that will be render(disply to the DOM) area.

  in this area we can write jsx also with in curly praces.

  before return statement we can write normal script.

  one react file divide by in two section(javascript+html) or (code logic + render area)

  that is beatuty of react.

*.lastly browser does not understand jsx need transpiler to understand the code.

  babel third party library helping to convert  jsx code into normal javascript
